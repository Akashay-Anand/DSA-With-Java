/*
 * The class is based on the basic principle of last-in-first-out. In addition to the basic push and pop operations, the class provides three more functions of empty, search and peek.
 * 
 * // Operation (LIFO)
 * 
 * isEmpty() // return true is stack is empty
 * push() // add element into stack
 * pop() // delete element from stack
 * peek() // 
 * search() //
 * size() // return size of stack;
 * 
 * Note: Please note that the Stack class in Java is a legacy class and inherits from Vector in Java. It is a thread-safe class and hence involves overhead when we do not need thread safety. It is recommended to use ArrayDeque for stack implementation as it is more efficient in a single-threaded environment.
 * 
 * thread-safe : threadsafe means that it is safe to be accessed from multiple threads. When you are using multiple threads in a program and they are each attempting to access a common data structure or location in memory several bad things can happen
 * A piece of code is thread-safe if it functions correctly during simultaneous execution by multiple threads.‚Äù
